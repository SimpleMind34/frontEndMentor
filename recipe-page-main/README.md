### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned that the list styles take the color of their text and you can't change that, so I used the before and after pseudo elements to change that
- I learned that _grid_ display can be so useful in aligning items mush more that the _flex_ display (but not in all cases)
  [for example]:
  .flex-table-row {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  justify-content: space-between;
  }
  this code solved for me the problem of aligning the **.bold.brown** spans at the beggining, which I couldn't figure with _display: flex;_

  - using % values will help you with responsivity better than px values, you should try it.

### Continued development

There for I think I must work more on the _grid_ functionalities

### Useful resources

I didn't use so much external resources in this particular project, bu t I would like to highlight the sources I learned CSS from

- [resource 1](https://elzero.org/) - This helped me learn all the basic concepts and the advanced ones, but it is in arabic
- [Example resource 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - freecodecamp helped me practice and get the certificate for responsive web design
